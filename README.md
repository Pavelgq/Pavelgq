- 👋 Hi, I'm @Pavelgq
- 👀 Interested in interface design, technology, software architecture and code quality.
- 🌱 I am currently learning typescript, effector js and English.
- 💞️ I want to collaborate on products which make everyday life easier. I can work "for food" if the project gives me experience and you will answer my question about software architecture.
- 📫 You can tweet me @atmeengineer.
